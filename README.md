# RpgGame

A realtime RPG with roguelike elements that was created as an homage to the old cRPG genre. Featuring real time combat with pausing system.
Currently abandoned, this is one of the many iterations of a multi year D&D like project.

It is developed using Java 7 and <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">LibGDX</a>, and can be used as a Desktop game and on Android devices.
